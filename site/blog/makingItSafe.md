# Making It Safe for Your Team to Experiment

You're on a great team. _**They always find a way.**_ Nothing will stop them from maintaining the most super-competitive web presence, _**as long as there's a safe place for them to experiment.**_

## Don't Want to Go Backwards?

_"What we have works! We don't want to put that at risk!"_ And it's true - no one wants to risk losing the gains already made.

The web is changing so fast, what made for success a couple years ago - might not be what makes for success in 2021 or 2023.

_**"A web presence is critical to our team's success."**_ So let's not go backwards.

Few things can be more stifling than a previous success, so make sure fear of change doesn't prevent you from improving!

## What Makes for a Safe Place?

We need to be able to run experiments. Quickly and cheaply.

Our competition is coming out with lots of really promising web technology - constantly.

- _**Lightning fast**_ pages
- New _**features**_
- Drop in _**Web Components**_ that they found on the web
- _**Vendor**_ enhancements that nobody even thought about a year ago
- Different looks and _**graphic designs**_
- _**A/B testing**_ to measure which things work the best

So we need a place to try all this stuff on our local machines, first. Or on internal only - test sites. Whatever it takes.

And it has to be _**fast failures.**_ "Safe" in this context can never mean that it takes longer than a few minutes to run an experiment. The danger? Running out of time or budget.

## Tooling Up for Safe Experiments

WordPress can make for _muuuch_ slower experiments - and that's putting the best possible spin on it.

That's because 2003 technology (as in WordPress) wasn't _designed_ for fast, safe experiments, it was designed to _**allow non-technical people to get their site up by themselves,**_ without tech assistance. 

I'm making some declarative statements here that aren't always true for slower moving teams. WP isn't always a black hole - especially in the initial years. You'll know, when it's time to migrate your team to something more nimble.

For 2021 and beyond, you may want something more akin to an [SSG](https://jamstack.org/generators/) where you can _**run an experiment on your computer in seconds.**_ I use [Rocket](/blog/11tyRocketIntro/) but there are plenty of other great SSG alternatives.

SSGs require minimal tech staff to set up, but that doesn't mean that it's difficult. More like - unfamiliar, at first. Nowadays, all corporate teams have access to minimally skilled tech staff - and that's enough to get started.

## The P.o.C. is Your Friend

Would your team rather have another gruelling meeting about this or that abstract idea?

How about not? _**How about just authorize a quick Proof of Concept?**_ 

Deploy it to an internal site. _THEN_ you can have your meeting, only it won't be about hypothetical crazy fears that live in the shadows of manager's minds. It will be on the deployed **P**roof **o**f **C**oncept site.

Your meeting about the proposal can be fast, _concrete,_ and to the point.

## There is Even a Technical Approach to Safety

This isn't a technical article, so I will only mention this in passing: **Regression Testing** on SSGs is relatively easy and normal to do.

If you're not technical, that's just a fancy way of saying _**when some experiment breaks something unrelated, you can be informed automatically,**_ without checking every page and feature manually.

Regression Testing _**does require**_ a technical person to maintain. That's the fine print.

## Outsourcing Options?

Yes, of course you can outsource a P.o.C. to [someone like myself.](https://datafundamentals.com)
