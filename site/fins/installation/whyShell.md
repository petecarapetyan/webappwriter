# Installation >> Why Shell || 80

FIXME acknowledge the many valid concerns that could be raised about using a shell script for installation. There are so many! And they are definitely valid, even if doing it despite those concerns.

One suggestion to include would be to [read and understand the script itself](https://github.com/petecarapetyan/fins-rocket-themes/blob/main/try.sh) before running it.

Another is to simply do the [manual approach](/fins/installation/manual/) ugh
