## Finished themes? Or starter/customizeable?

Finished themes could eventually be installed [as rocket presets, like this long since deprecated theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webappwriter/not-alphabet-rocket-theme). The install process works perfectly, but it totally works against the personalization/customization process. 

This is because your theme files are all mixed up with rocket files in the _\_merged_... folders, so there is no way that anyone who is not already a rocket genius can know where to proceed with the customization and personalization process.

So that's why Fins don't go this route, even though it is technically very easy to produce the presets.
