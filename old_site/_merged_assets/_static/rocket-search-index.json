I wasn't going down that road again, not if I didn't have to.  \nMy first app was in 1973 - that's a lot of experience with abandonware :( \n\nEven stuff I learned in 2015 is starting to look like more and more like abandonware.

Think bootstrap, or JS frameworks that shout \"me, me, me\" and contribute nonstandard helpers that the browser or SSG could now handle with ease. Might feel like abandonware to me, yet others may simply feel pushed away, or blocked from joining the party. \n\nSo instead, can I build from What skills does EVERY  developer already have to own?   Can an SSG work, when it only requires the absolute minimum developer skillset? \n\nGit \nHTML/CSS/JS - at least to some very introductory beginner level \nMarkup - pretty much everyone has migrated to that, for docs \nNpm (or Yarn, or ...) \nShell capabilities \n \nMaybe if you own those skills, that is also enough?   \nThen, browser standards . If I can look it up on MDN or caniuse.com, it's a standard. Docs will be plentiful. Vendors and enthusiasts are going to tool to it.

How to take advantage?","section":"blog"},"25":{"title":"The Sweet Spot","headline":"In search of that \"framework\"?","body":"The \"framework\" or platform is a decades old idea to solve a decades old problem. The browser standard was immature, and the DOM - and even JS, a little bit, sucked. Enter the \"framework\" to solve the problem. \nExcept, it wasn't a problem. It was a set  of - ahem - opportunities?  Is that the positive  spin? Different frameworks evolved, year after year, to address each opportunity, in different ways. Soon it became \"I'm an Angular developer\" or \"I'm a React developer\" or Drupal, or .... \nA framework included all that stuff that the language and the browser standard didn't have. So now we get to work as a tribe, be buddies, share an ecosystem - go DX ! \nThat's why \"better\" isn't necessarily better. \n\nAbusing a racist metaphor from the American West - \"Cowboys and Indians\"  has made up movie plots, childhood games, and more. Let's try it on for it's visceral impact: \nFramework wars depend on keeping our guns loaded and sticking together. Framework growth depends on keeping the browser standard immature and JS and the DOM sucky. We stick with the framework's adaptations that we know, and we code quickly, as a result. \nCowboys and Indians may be out of date and even distasteful as a metaphor, but competition between frameworks is quite the contemporary reality. \nSpeed and efficiency comes from knowing the lingo of our \"side\", not always the relative merits of the development platform. That's an important distinction. \nSo that's the first pattern we look to exploit - providing whatever we need within a singular ecosystem.

Webpack or Rollup? Lit or FAST?  These tests are never definitive, because the answers differ depending on context, and even which version of which stack on which day. So we still test for these, and we prepare ourselves for switching out stacks when our development context demands it. Clean hygiene is the logic gate, here. Sometimes, as viewed through a lens such as Lighthouse  \nCRO:  WUT? Since when is CRO  even an issue for a dev? Isn't that on the business side? CRO is about results.

Results is all   that matters in a mature business context. \n \nThe proposal here is that these 3 tests give us instantaneous answers, even if they are always changing. \nSo now we still have some grey areas in the form of contextual switches, but Little Red Ridng Hood now has a safe route to grandma's house, and it's not just \"which tribe am I in?\" any more.","section":"blog"},"29":{"title":"The Sweet Spot","headline":"Downstream takeaway: OWC","body":"If you were autistic like me, you might be exasperated by that human thing about following a large tribe.

And then there are config files to manage the forms and interaction between the SQL engine. \nSSGs don't have all that UI, but neither do they need it. Not that much complexity to manage - it's all just dumb files, and since there is no UI or DB to manage, considerably fewer, to boot.","section":"blog"},"1f":{"title":"Friendlier than WordPress?","headline":"PHP vs [random template engine]","body":"Any code that is required to build a site has to be maintained, so the less there is, the friendlier it is to customize and add features to. \nNow that we have no database or UI to manage, it's already a lot friendlier codebase to maintain.

More and more functionality arrived in a-la-carte pieces - many by the same vendors like Shopify that also created WP plugins. \nSo now we have this odd situation where you can get stuff in either lightweight JS/REST packages and APIs, or in complex harder to maintain WP plugins.

That editor made the process super friendly, and still does, today. \nBut then Wikis showed up, and millions of us began doing most of our writing in text editors, just because, frankly, we didn't have the patience to mess with rich text. Many cute languages evolved to serve this fast shorthand, and Markup ended up being the standard, now 20 years later. \nThis article was written in a text editor. It may appear, to you, as rich text. But like I said, I really don't have the patience for writing in rich text, and I can do anything with Markup that I need to do. \nJAMstack uses regular old markup. No rich text to make formatting decisions about. No complex processes. Dumb, super fast, and I can use CSS to force all the pages to look the same.

They are certainly friendlier than their UI driven predecessors  \nSSGs use a sequential overwrite based on inputs  pattern. \nThere are three very serious   side effects to this otherwise friendly pattern: \n\nthe overwrite  part \nthe sequence  part \nthe inputs  part \n \nSince all of these are attempts to give you freedom,   maybe that's why I never hear people talking about the side effects. Freedom is supposed to feel positive, not overwhelming. \nBut I spend unwanted minutes(?) on the side effects - sometimes on a daily basis. Maybe that's because I'm autistic so I don't shift contexts as nimbly as others? Either way, here's how I compensate for all that freedom.","section":"fins"},"4s":{"title":"Friendly Customization","headline":"The overwrite foot-gun","body":"To illustrate, let's compare strongly typed and weakly typed languages. In strongly typed, once you establish a structure it can't be overwritten. It is simply impossible. SSGs are more analogous to the weakly typed languages   - overwrites are just taken for granted, for the most part. Freedom. \nOr CSS. You can set the same selector value in 10 different places in 7 different CSS files all referenced by a single HTML page. But only one has any effect,   usually. Allowing that kind of freedom could be considered friendly, but it can also leave me searching dev tools for which one?  \nIn this sense, templating systems are their own house of horrors, and they all tend to share this same foot gun. Pretty much by definition, a templating system loops over stuff and writes wherever and however it needs to,   to get the job done. Overwrites aren't even discussed as an issue, they are just writes . If they also over-write, then it's just them trying to be friendly and let you write what you need to write. \nWhat all this means is that SSGs can give you a lot of overwrite styled foot guns by trying to be super friendly. Like any foot-guns, some degree of extra care may be required if you like your feet.","section":"fins"},"4t":{"title":"Friendly Customization","headline":"Strategy 1 - It's the sequence!","body":"How to learn what sequence the SSG overwrites? \nOne remedy to all that freedom is spending a few seconds really grokking the sequences that a page is written in, or CSS is applied in. If the overwrites are always in the correct sequence, it's never a problem, right? The last one was the one you wanted, anyway. Friendly! \nSo the first strategy is just make sure you're aware of these two specific types of sequences so you know where to apply any changes. Neither is hard to find and internalize, nor do you have to be a template coder to grasp the sequence. \n\nWhich css files get applied in which sequence? \nWhich template loops get run in which sequence? \n \nOnce you have these two things identified you can quickly resolve any otherwise time consuming sequenced overwrite problem. Or, as easily as possible. \nDon't even get me started on the giant foot gun that CSS is.","section":"fins"},"4u":{"title":"Friendly Customization","headline":"Strategy 2 - It's the inputs!","body":"Here's a fun twist - 11ty's best feature can break your flow   - if you have what seems to be the \"normal\" approach to time management. \n\n11ty is way flexible  . Lots-o-different ways to do the data thing. \nNormal human time management means RTFM is not even   the first order of the day. \n \n#2 above works as the default, for me. Except in the presence of #1 above. That's when I wish I had forced myself to RTFM. So here's my RTFM list, in case you want travel deep into the land of customizing an 11ty site: \n\nThe Data Cascade  - holy smoke I never thought I'd see so many great ways to collect structured input in one platform! And Rocket seems to use them all. \nCollections , of what? \nRocket Navigation  is totally intuitive when you see it in action, if not yet at the docs level. \n \nBy this time you're beginning to maybe not wonder what \"frontmatter\" is, and other contextually defined words from the 11ty world. \nRecapping, for emphasis: SSGs in general, and 11ty/Rocket specifically, might be easier to personalize/customize after a specific chunk of RTFM, first. Or at least that's true when it comes to taking in data structures as inputs.  \nDon't forget, the structured input data provided by these files is replacing an entire structured database and admin-UI for a CMS such as WordPress. There's a reason why that data is so important to the process.","section":"fins"},"4v":{"title":"Friendly Customization","headline":"Strategy 3 - It's the workflow","body":"So I'm just going to come out and say it. SSGs are a much different workflow than other coding workflows I have used. \nIf you ever got coached in woodworking, someone warned you \"Measure twice, cut once.\" A lot of coding workflows are like that. I think about the design carefully, try stuff out, then refactor after the long coding session. That's just how the process works, for a lot of us. \nBy comparison, I find that SSGs are more like mowing the lawn. You just, well, mow the lawn. Thinking isn't so much a part of the process, and the best part is the instant gratification. \nHow long does it take to run an experiment in an SSG? Sometimes it's just saving a file, you don't even have to restart localhost. Worst case is 3 seconds to tab back to the shell and control C up arrow to restart localhost, such as if you renamed a file. \nSo here are some guidelines that I use for SSGs, that may be different from more typical coding that you or I do as software developers. \n\nReligiously stick to the only change one very small thing rule  and then check it out. \nCommit much more frequently than normal  coding - then use your IDE to double check git diffs, before each commit. \ndev tools  play more prominently in my SSG workflows than other types of coding that I do. \n \nAs a result of all these high velocity trivial commits, I end up with a hyperactive git log where all the commits are labeled WIP  but since most were so trivial, I never seem to care. I still do the occassional rollback, but I'll just use commit dates and fast experiments rather than try to nail the rigtht rollback on the first attempt. YMMV.","section":"fins"},"4w":{"title":"Friendly Customization","headline":"Other Rocket features you may need to RTFM","body":"You may find these Rocket explorations  handy for understanding how the various parts of every Rocket page work together. \nThere are, of course, other things such as the Markdown plugin that you also might want to read about, but I didn't find them very likely to get in my way during the process of customization or personalization.","section":"fins"},"4x":{"title":"Installation: Manual Install","headline":"Installation: Manual Install","body":"TL;DR; Permanent daim bramage could result from attempting to follow the instructions on this page :)  \nOne option would be to return to shell script installation  as a more positive experience.","section":"fins"},"4y":{"title":"Installation: Manual Install","headline":"High Level","body":"Setting aside the attempt at humor above, manual installs are a rather tedious and error prone process.

With Rocket, you just write your Markdown files, and Rocket takes care of all the navigation &#x26; menus from Markdown headings. Huge win!   You can still customize to your heart's content, but most of the time, I don't have to. \nThe second thing is JS. Why? I love composing content in Markdown - it's super fast and easy. Like this page, for example - I'm writing in a frkn text editor. Can't get much snappier than that! But I'm not building a web site, I'm building a dynamic web presence! That's just fancy talk for JS and Web Components, for the most part. \nMJDS lets me do anything dynamic  by staying in Markdown and still having all the JS and Web Components I want. Another big win.  \nThe last critical piece that Rocket gives me is a default Service Worker maintained by someone other than myself.  Don't even get me started on how much I don't enjoy jacking with a service worker, Workbox or not. \n\n  \n    \n  \n    Caught a mistake or want to contribute to the documentation?\n    Edit this page on GitHub!","section":"fins"},"7d":{"title":"WebAppWriter Blog","headline":"WebAppWriter Blog\n            Making It Safe for Your Team to Experiment","body":"A competitive team must be able to experiment to maintain a web presence \n          ...read more","section":"blog"},"7e":{"title":"WebAppWriter Blog","headline":"Ultra-Competitors and a Web Presence","body":"How Do the Ultra Competitive Approach a Web Presence? \n          ...read more","section":"blog"},"7f":{"title":"WebAppWriter Blog","headline":"Can Shift Be Fun?","body":"Shifting From WordPress, Can It Be Fun? \n          ...read more","section":"blog"},"7g":{"title":"WebAppWriter Blog","headline":"Intro - Friends W Benfits Components","body":"Intro to the SPA vs MPA approaches \n          ...read more","section":"blog"},"7h":{"title":"WebAppWriter Blog","headline":"11ty Rocket Intro","body":"Opinionated perspective on when to use Rocket, which is also 11ty \n          ...read more","section":"blog"},"7i":{"title":"WebAppWriter Blog","headline":"WordPress Migration Budgets","body":"What is a good WordPress migration budget? \n          ...read more","section":"blog"},"7j":{"title":"WebAppWriter Blog","headline":"WordPress Outliers - 1.
