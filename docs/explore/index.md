# Exploring Performance Specs

This is the main part of the webAppWriter site - the _**site as a performance spec**_ part.

This exploration is very early in the game. It may keep forming day by day, for months or years.

## Rocket as Reference Implementation

If Wordpress had been designed in 2021 instead of 2003, it might have looked like [rockect](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/)

Rocket was written for developers, not content providers. So don't worry that it will be a threat to the 39% of the internet currently on Wordpress.

But for the 4 million of us that live and work on git, are comfortable in HTML/CSS, and write in Markdown, working to a performance spec is an easy shift.

With rocket, a live site can continue to morph to the performance spec as it develops, because updates are as instantaneous as `git commit -m ...` and `git push`, no fancy back end with SQL and complex table sets. Just simple 11ty and automagical navigation on deployment.

And I wrote this in Markdown. Kinda sweet, huh?

## Web as App?

Even before asking about the specifics of a performance spec, we have to ask ourselves if the difference between web and app is even real, any more?

## Performance Specification

Did this site perform to spec when you and I actually connected and exchanged thoughts? Or just when I shoveled out the content to a server?

This is the question that this site hopes to explore.
