## Can it be easy?

If current stacks allow a single dev to hit the sweet spot - we're going to find out here.

Because hitting that sweet spot is all that matters, at least for some of us.

2 out of 3 flat out misses the target. That's a fail.

So that is what I explore here. If I do it right, it will even look easy - thanks to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and now, [rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/)
