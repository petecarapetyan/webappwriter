# Exploring Performance Specs

This is the main function of this site is the _**site as a performance spec**_ part.

This exploration is very early in the game. It may keep forming day by day, for months or years.

## Initial Performance Spec

If both of us can check below, then any content "performs" to spec.

- [ ] You receive sufficient benefit from visiting
- [ ] I as provider received sufficient benefit from your visit

Unpacking the above could get hairy. A Task for another day.

One thing we _**can**_ do, however, is make it dumber/simpler/faster for a content provider(me) to keep adjusting the content to fit the visitor's(you) needs. This is adjustment _**may be the core**_ of the performance spec.

## Pass/Fail in real time

There's only one way to know if you are meeting a performance spec, at least _if you're being honest with yourself._

It has to be measureable in real time.

With real numbers.

Against real expectations.

And it has to measure against the closest thing that you can get to the real representation of your target, not a distant facsimile. Maybe that's the hardest part, but we can at least try.

There are plenty of people doing this, every single day. You can, too.

## Rocket as Reference Implementation

This site is written in [rockect](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/). How is this relevant?

If Wordpress had been designed in 2021 instead of 2003, it might have looked like rocket.

Rocket was written for developers, not content providers. So don't worry that it will be a threat to the 39% of the internet currently on Wordpress.

But for the 4 million of us that

- live and work on git
- are comfortable in HTML/CSS
- write in Markdown
- use npm (and probably VsCode) as our daily tools

... then working to a performance spec using rocket is an easy shift, and could make our primary objectives more likely to succeed.

With rocket, a live site can continue to morph to the performance spec as it develops, because updates are as instantaneous as an npm command or `git commit -m ...` and `git push`, no fancy back end with SQL and complex table sets. Just simple 11ty and automagical navigation on deployment.

And I wrote this in Markdown. Does this make you wonder about your own site?

## Web as App?

Even before asking about the specifics of a performance spec, we have to ask ourselves if the difference between web and app is even real, any more?

## Performance Specification

Did this site perform to spec when you and I actually connected and exchanged thoughts? Or just when I shoveled out the content to a server?

This is the question that this site hopes to explore.
