## Skills follow standards

This is the painful part. 

When web standards move, it is my obligation to move with them.

"Ugh" says anyone other than those leading the move on the standards.

### Implicit pain points

My job in this new world is to remain cheerful and positive within the context of all known pain points:

- stop what i am doing and learn new stuff even when it is inconvenient (which is always)
- replace previous home-made workarounds with [whatever it takes] that supports the new standards
- almost no one will like me. Because they want to do things the "normal" way and I am effing that up
- guaranteed inefficiencies because newer standards might not be as well tooled as the legacy stuff
- guaranteed refactoring schedules imposed externally
- guaranteed disagreements imposed externally
- 

### Alleged benefits

- always up to date
- my code has greatest chance of a long life
- yada
