# Race Wordpress With an SSG || 11

This assumes you are one of the 4 million people that work with these stacks as part of your daily routine:

- git
- npm
- markup
- standard HTML

If you're thinking you need to stick with something like Wordpress just because it's so fast to do the basic stuff, let's try them in an SSG like [Rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/):

## A Game - 5 Timed Activities

The game is to do each of these from scratch, see how long it takes. _**You lose if any one thing**_ takes too long:

- [New Page](/explore/raceWordpress/#new-page)
- [Page Update](/explore/raceWordpress/#new-update)
- [New Image](/explore/raceWordpress/#new-image)
- [Theme Modification](/explore/raceWordpress/#theme-modification)
- [Raw Power at your fingertips]

NOTE: The videos below are intended more as a proof that the tasks can be done in the time claimed.

## New Page

We created a new page in 2 1/2 minutes. Here's the youtube:

## Theme Modification

"Ahah!" you say. "But what about when I need to modify my visual themes! That's where something like Wordpress really shines!"

No need for a Wordpress UI that manages a DB that maintains properties that tell PHP how to write HTML/CSS to a client. Exhausting, just to think about, eh? This is simple dumb stuff. Just go straight to the HTML/CSS.

Here's 1min 18sec to modify your theme, as an example:

## Raw Power at your fingertips

The game gets really fun when you can add someone else's work without having to fight the platform. 

How long would it take to add a powerful web component where the magic was all encapsulated inside?
