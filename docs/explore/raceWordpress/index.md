# Race WordPress With an SSG || 11

This assumes you are one of the 4 million people that work with these stacks as part of your daily routine:

- git
- npm
- markup
- standard HTML

If you're thinking you need to stick with something like WordPress just because it's so fast to do the basic stuff, let's try them in an SSG like [Rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/):

## TLDR Version

Couple minutes each for these 5 basic activities? Even if you could beat that with WordPress (doubtful), is 2003 WordPress tech a better choice?

## A Game - 5 Timed Activities

The game is to do each of these from scratch, see how long it takes. _**You lose if any one thing**_ takes too long:

- [New Page](/explore/raceWordPress/#new-page)
- [Page Update](/explore/raceWordPress/#page-update)
- [New Image](/explore/raceWordPress/#new-image)
- [Theme Modification](/explore/raceWordPress/#theme-modification)
- [Raw Power, at Your Fingertips](/explore/raceWordPress/#raw-power-at-your-fingertips)

## New Page

We created a new page in 2 1/2 minutes. Here's the youtube used to time the racing game:

## Page Update

We updated the page with the above video, took a couple minutes.

## New Image

How long would it take to add this new image?

## Theme Modification

"Ahah!" you say. "But what about when I need to modify my visual themes! That's where something like WordPress really shines!"

No need for a WordPress UI that manages a DB that maintains properties that tell PHP how to write HTML/CSS to a client. Exhausting, just to _think_ about. This is simple dumb stuff. A good SSG should go straight to the HTML/CSS.

Here's 1min 18sec to modify your theme, as an example:

## Raw Power, at Your Fingertips

This _racing-WordPress game_ gets _**really**_ fun when you can add someone else's complex work straight into you Markup page.

Generic web components can be as small as a text widget or as big as a whole app, all on drop in componet. 

How long would it take to add a complex web component to this page?

Here's the video documenting the couple minutes that it took:

PAGE NOTES: 

- _The videos shown on this page are intended more as a proof that the tasks can be done in the time claimed._
- _Audio kinda sucks in these videos, but that's OK - because purpose was just to time the process for the game_
