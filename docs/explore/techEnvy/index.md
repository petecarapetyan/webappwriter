# Tech Envy || 10

You might be **tech-envious** when you learn how little effort goes into producing and maintaining this site.

## Background:

We got a surprising number of requests for "How to move migrate from Wordpress?" in our 2020 sales and estimating counts.

Why?

Corporations of all sizes had a love affair with Wordpress since 2003. But with an install base of 39 million sites, there's a lot of searching for something better.

Here is what I learned that [our](https://victorycto.com/) clients were looking for:

- More **effortless** to add and edit content
- Waay **less complexity**. This isn't 2003 any more, why are we still coding that way?
- Increasingly **higher expectations** of performance _and_ mobile/offline features
- **Doesn't require special technical skills** to manage
- Only when desired - **_natural_ for even the most demanding app developer**

## What the site you are looking at _does without_

- No more 2003 era SQL database - plain old files work great, maintained in [git](http://github.com/), duh.
- No more back end server running to assemble necessary page parts on request.
- No more complex or hard to manage menu creation or management

## What  the site you are looking at _does include_

- Works like a desktop or mobile app - on and off line
- Really dumbed down page composition, on simple Markup, just like github, for example.
- Plain old HTML/CSS/JS/TS, with just a little bit of [Nunjucks template language](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html)
- Insert and run _any_ extra app-like javascript on _any_  page
- [CRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_rate_optimization) is running, to A-B test your interest as a site consumer.

_Check it out on your phone! Go offline! Check it for speed!_

## When  does this platform go mainstream?

The site you are looking at is created in a pre-release version of [Rocket](https://Rocket.modern-web.dev/). Expected to go 1.0 in 2021.
