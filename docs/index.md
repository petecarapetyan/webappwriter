# Sweet Spot

## Can it be easy?

If current stacks allow a single dev to hit the sweet spot - we're going to find out here.

Because hitting that sweet spot is all that matters, at least for some of us.

2 out of 3 flat out misses the target. That's a fail.

So that is what I explore here. If I do it right, it will even look easy - thanks to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and now, [rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/)

## About not re-inventing the wheel

Legacy frameworks have been re-inventing the browser's DOM standards for the last couple decades. Hey! It was necessary - the DOM was lacking.

But now we have the opposite problem - if I trained up in a legacy framework - now it's faster to just use that legacy framework, than it is to train up to the latest standards. So we end up with Angular and React and lots of other stacks that have already been replaced with much lighter and more nimple browser-standards - and even the best developers don't know how to use them, without taking time off to re-learn.

Doesn't have to be that way.

## About letting Rocket get you started

If you're a smart developer, you got that way by ignoring 99% of the noise that would just waste your time. This or that **new thing** isn't always the best expenditure of a dev's time.

What you might like about Rocket, when it is released, is that it's built from browser-standard dumb stuff by hard-core practitioners of building from browser-standard dumb stuff. And it's built from standard parts like 11ty by devs who are creative about not re-inventing or using a legacy tool once a standard matures and is easily adopted.

Much as I'd like to drag you through a word salad extolling the 100 ways to illustrate where Rocket does that for you, how about not? Yes, Rocket lets you focus on the your content (or your app) the way the React or other ecosystems do. To validate , instead search for your area of interest around 11ty, Markup, buildless web, Web Components, Lit, and all the other pieces that Rocket does for you. Or, just browse through the code for yourself.

## CRO vs Good Feelings

It can feel good to be creative and put out helpful content. But, as developers - should we stop there?

If gppd feelings are enough for you, then the above Sweet Spot diagram doesn't apply to you. 2 out of 3 is fine.

But I've been doing the good feelings thing for a couple decades, and all that content hasn't served a commercial purpose. Now it's time for me to learn that part, as well.

[CRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_rate_optimization) is well worn path, the tools are popular and free, and Rocket integrates them easily. 

So I'm going to document some of that progress here, to compare notes with others and invite future contracts.

If it slows me down, then I'm doing something wrong. More will be revealed.

## Fins - Rocket Themes

When Rocket releases later this year, you might conclude that it's a bit like what Henry Ford "Any color you want, as long as it's black". 

You can customize it, sure, but it's not a trivial affair like WordPress or Drupal themes would be.

So I started coding up 18 or so rocket themes. [Fins](/rocket-themes) They aren't very far along, but it at least exercises the process and helps us get started.
