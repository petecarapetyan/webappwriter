# Just from a little freedom?

I didn't expect a surge in creativity, just from adopting a smaller toolset. That wasn't one of my expectations, trying out an SSG.

Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised. Either way, it felt good, and it still does, today. If I feel more creative and productive, my work is more meaningful. Maybe that's just personal.

## Other Objectives

My motivations were much more practical.

Visitors need to feel welcome, and few things are more offputting than a slow site or bad metrics. So I knew that I had to get these numbers in the 90s, that wasn't optional.

And it had to be a legit PWA.

But I also felt I needed to be able to bring in the latest tech. I've had to abandon so much work over the years.

Even stuff I learned in 2014 is starting to look like abandonware. React or LAMP stack, anyone?

So if it's not at least

- browser standard
- the latest JS

Yeah, that wasn't going to work. Let's keep it simple.

## Core Skills Only

Starting out with almost mechanical objectives and ending up with some kind of abstract feeling of freedom and productivity - yeah, that's pretty weird.

But there was a bit more. Let's be blunt: I'm not just old, I'm ancient - at least for the tech world. When you're old, stuff that requires way more specialized skills than might be necessary - it starts to have a smell to it. Nothing wrong with that specifically, just seems to be a part of all that abandonware that makes up so much of my career.

So I think about **What does _EVERY_ developer have to own?** &nbsp;We really need to ask that question, because maybe the minimum might also work pretty well as a kind of maximum?

- git
- HTML/CSS/JS - at least to some very introductory beginner level
- Markup - pretty much everyone has migrated to this, somewhere
- NPM (or Yarn, ... equivalents)
- some kind of vague shell capabilities

Maybe if you own those skills, that is also _**enough?**_

And then there's browser standards. If I can look it up on MDN or caniuse.com, then it's a standard, docs will be plentiful, and all the vendors are going to tool to it. Stuff that is written to that standard will have to work for years, if not decades.

Anything outside of the above isn't bad, it just makes me, well, suspicious that I'm wasting my time. And I probably have a lot less time to waste than you do, years wise :)

## WordPress Got Themes Right

So the last piece for me has been themes, and that's where I invest my time, recently.

Because dynamic request servers and silly wp-admin UI and the LAMP stack will never be missed, in my world. But those themes - people need that. I need that. Just, maybe not inside WordPress.

So that's why I wrote Fins - Rocket Themes

I hope that some people find them useful. But either way, I've had a terrific time creating them.
