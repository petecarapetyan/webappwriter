# A surge in creativity?

I didn't expect a surge in creativity by migrating to an SSG. No wonder SSGs are so popular with tech types.

Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised. I gotta work, that's not optional. Meaningful, as a side effect of productivity? That's extra.

## Other Objectives

My _motivations_ were much more from the _practical_ side.

Visitors need to feel welcome, and few things are more off-putting than a slow site or bad metrics. So I knew that I had to peg these numbers.

And it had to be a legit Progressive Web App, or PWA. This is 2021. 'Table stakes.'

There are 200+ SSG variants, already. So I filtered out everything with a dependency on legacy stacks. I've had to abandon so many finished projects because of legacy dependencies. _I wasn't going down that road again, not if I didn't have to._

My first app was in 1973, so that's a lot of abandonware :(

Even stuff I learned in 2015 is starting to look like more and more like abandonware. React/JSX, anyone?

So if it's _not at least_

- browser standard
- the latest JS

Yeah, that's a fail. Keep it simple.

## Core Skills Only

Starting out with mechanical objectives and ending up with - uh, ethereal feelings of freedom and productivity - yeah, that's a win. _But there was more._

But there's a different kind of legacy stack, a special helper library that takes specialized skillset - it starts to have a smell to it. Think frameworks that contribute nonstandard helpers that the browser or SSG can handle fine, now. Part of all that abandonware that makes up so much of my career.

So I pivot from **What skills do _EVERY_ developer have to own?** &nbsp;Can an SSG work, when it only requires the absolute minimum developer skillset?

- git
- HTML/CSS/JS - at least to some very introductory beginner level
- Markup - pretty much everyone has migrated to that, for docs
- NPM (or Yarn, ... equivalents?)
- some kind of vague shell capabilities

Maybe if you own those skills, that is also _**enough?**_

And then there are **browser standards**. If I can look it up on MDN or caniuse.com, it's a standard. Docs will be plentiful. Vendors and enthusiasts are going to tool to it. Stuff that is written to that standard will have to work for years, if not decades.

Anything outside of the above kicks off the alarm bells that I might be wasting my time. I probably have fewer years to waste, than you do :)

## WordPress Got Themes Right

The last piece for me has been themes, and that's where I invest my time, recently.

Dynamic request servers, self defeating wp-admin UI, and the LAMP stack will never be missed, in my world. But those WordPress themes - people needed that! Heck, I need them. Just, maybe not the WordPress part.

So that's why I wrote [Fins - Rocket Themes](/fins/)

I hope that some people find these themes useful. I've had fun creating them.
