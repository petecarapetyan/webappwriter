# Will WordPress go the way of the dodo bird?

**TL;DR :**

WordPress won't disappear in 2022. But it _is_ extremely vulnerable to 3 assumptions that millennials often laugh at.

The pressure for something simpler is too great to resist.

<hr>

## One day, all the gas station attendants disappeared

Assumptions about what people can do "all by themselves" can be humorous. For decades, consumers were _**never allowed to even touch**_ gas pumps. Then one day around 1980, all the gas station attendants went home for good. What happened? A year or so of "self service gas" caused the underlying assumption to fail.

WordPress was invented in 2003 when people were simply not allowed to do certain things, like touch important files. But then the millenials entered the work force, now almost everyone touches important files. Turns out it wasn't all that dangerous, just like pumping gas.

But wait. What about all that super complex server side WordPress code?

## The back pressure is intense

There is _zero pressure to eliminate WordPress_ on simple sites.  So _**Billy's Blog**_ is great. Yes, it is true that WordPress is like using a sledgehammer to swat a fly, in that situation. But still, no harm, no foul.

WordPress sites with any kind of custom dynamic capability however, have been causing noticeable pain in corporate settings. _What corporate setting DOES NOT require increasingly dynamic, lightweight, one-of-a-kind, app like capabilities?_

You can customize WordPress with plugins, themes, and even your own code. But corporate teams have found that _**those customizations can fight each other, and become increasingly brittle to maintain over the years**_. The pressure to solve that problem becomes intense. _Think long schedules, fat budgets._ Who gains, from this loss? Really nobody, since WordPress is free.

## It's the design

WordPress was invented in 2003.

Three takeaways from 2003-era assumptions make the WordPress market vulnerable

1. Since users & admins can't touch files, we must give them a **complex online admin interface** to keep the users coloring between the lines, so to speak.
1. A web page must be **assembled on a server with every request**. The server has to know how to do this.
1. The first two assumptions imply that we gotta have a **database and heavily structured code** to keep all that stuff straight. Enter: [LAMP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)).

Even if these assumptions were not correct, **the assumptions support each other perfectly**. WordPress has been a tremendous success at 38m sites and growing. 

And so too, with it's brothers of similar design - Drupal, Joomla, etc. The CMS made Billy's Blog possible.

## Woops

What happens if

- Users and admins decide that it's **OK to touch files**.
- Users and admins assemble pages with boilerplate code **before loading onto servers**.

Gosh. Everything was going fine for WordPress, and now all of a sudden everything is so simple! We had this giant machine, and now you're doing it the easy way. Seems like cheating.

Gets worse for WordPress though, because Github spent years teaching millions of users that you can use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to write really decent content in minutes, if not seconds.

- Users and admins decide that **[markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is easier** than rich text for most content.

Ew boy. The super complex WordPress machine is feeling a bit vulnerable, at this point. Thank goodness for WordPress, there are plugins that people really need! All that cool add-on functionality from external vendors that you just can't get anywhere else! 

Then this:

- Vendors like Shopify start releasing their Wordpress plugin **functionality as [simpler javascript libraries and REST APIs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shopify-cartjs)**.

Millenials and even Xers start tipping the bucket over, right around this point. While their boomer friends were still trying to update/resolve conflicting and obsolete plugins, millennials started creating alternatives. Lots and lots of alternatives. For many, the CMS became more effort than it's worth.

- WUT? **"Server" is now a glorified [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)?**

The last blow happened, when vendors like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/) and even [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) appear on the scene, making web hosting appear more like a glorified extension of a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) than the [all-powerful server we envisioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server) in 2003.

## Enter: SSGs and JAMstack

Saying "[SSGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system#Static_site_generators) and/or [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)" is like saying "coffee shop."  There are half as many variations on the coffee shop, as there are corners to put them on.

If you're looking for the cliff notes version on what SSG or JAMstack is, think **"Not WordPress or similar heavyweight CMS"** and you may get close enough for this article.

So here is the main point. **You cannot expect** corporations around the world to keep consuming WordPress and the like, when it is more trouble than it is worth, and millennials and younger are the primary workforce. It's just not going to happen, at least not forever.

One corporate department at a time, the millennials will bring in SSGs and JAMstack and the boomers and their WordPress plugins will drift away to wherever [legacy stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) and their benefactors go.

And most importantly, the world will be a better place. Because the CMS is a variation on a [Rube Goldberg machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine), at this point. We have enough of those to support, already.

_**Full Disclosure**_  
The boomer :) author of this blog makes his living supporting [a variation of a JAMstack](https://github.com/petecarapetyan/fins-rocket-themes#readme). So opinions expressed above are _anything but_ objective.

If you like this article, _thank any of the thousands(?) of tireless contributors_ to open source SSGs all over the world.
