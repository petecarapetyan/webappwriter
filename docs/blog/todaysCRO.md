# Today's CRO

I'll spare you the long explanation about [Conversion Rate Optimization](/blog/sweetSpot/#cro-vs-good-feelings), but I'm using Google Optimize on this site to a-b test visitor behavior.

Then I can adjust the site to match what visitors seem to like better.

## Current A-B Test March 2, 2021 start

- half the visitors to [the race WordPress article](/blog/raceWordPress/) will see blue subheads.

This is clearly a case of not being able to think of anything to a-b test, so I just made up something stupid to have at least one thing to test. Or, you could say I was just testing the test...

I'll post results here.

## Previous A-B Test February 2021

### Was supposed to be this

Visitors to [techEnvy page](/blog/techEnvy/) with 2 fluffy photos.

- half the visitors will see the same page, only without the fluffy photos.

### Instead

Nothing happened because I didn't know how to work google optimize properly.
