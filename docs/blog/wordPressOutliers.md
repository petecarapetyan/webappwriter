# WordPress Outliers - 1. Devs, 2. Corporate Teams

Are you an outlier in the WordPress marketplace?

1. I'm a developer
2. I'm part of a serious corporate team

Neither of the above guarantees a WordPress fail. I'm a developer,
and I've been using WordPress successfully for over a decade.
Or, at least until I wanted to do some app-like stuff.

64 million sites run on WordPress.

Which of those 64 million sites might measure as a fail?

## 1. Developer

_"Dang, this is like trying to do a serious task with a [**Rube Goldberg** machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine)"_ 

WordPress _**has**_ to be complex, because it uses a back end database and complex UI
to maintain simple config for people who know nothing about configurations.

Devs have been moving to [simpler static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) for years, just because
a static site generator (SSG) is usually faster, simpler, cheaper, dumber.

Either approach - WP or SSG  does the same thing - compile content against templates. If you can do that simply, its a win. _**Double win**_, if you can also add app-like features painlessly - straight from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## 2. Corporate Team

Corporate teams are held to higher standards than the rest of us.

It's not just a site any more. It's a profit center. It's all about ROI. It might be part site, part app. _**It goes up against competitor's apps, in a fast moving marketplace**_

_"It worked great 5 years ago, now we need [ this and that ] to compete. We can keep adding plugins but we have staff, and they say they can barely keep the old plugins up to date, much less add new ones with confidence."_

Then it all starts to collapse under it's own weight, and nobody on the team
even wants to touch it any more. Competition? Oh well.

## 2020 was a watershed

I was working for a services shop in 2020. We started seeing a lot of cries for
help.

_"We are using WordPress. We're dying here. You gotta help us."_

So if you're in that group, you're not the only one.

That's why I pursued an alternative. [So far, the technology side seems to be working.](https://webappwriter.com/fins/thumbnails/) 

Now I just need to see if I can [generate some interest](https://datafundamentals.com/).
