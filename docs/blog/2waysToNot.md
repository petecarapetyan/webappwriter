# Re-defining Magic - a coder's perspective

This started as a story of misplaced feelings. As in - coders have lots of feelings about code. Like all feelings, some have to be set aside.

Couple years ago, I wanted to identify some magical properties re the work of my heroes from the previous 5 years. The magic was obvious. What wasn't so obvious was what made for that magic.

- Thankfully, my writing contribution on the magical properties was rebuffed - it plainly wasn't ready.
- Meanwhile, magic defined itself as much dumber than I thought.

`Spoiler alert. I won't identify the true magic. You'll only see some markers.`

## Where to Look for Magic in Code

As any LOTR fan knows, magic is pretty easy to identify. In code, it comes in the form of a benefit. If I can `npm -i something` that saves me a lot of effort, that's an easy win. Magic!

Now, two things have happened, both quite literal.

1. Saved some time.
1. Created a dependency

The world is good. Move on.
