# Installation >> With Presets || 70

## Finished themes? Or starter/customizeable?

Finished themes could eventually be installed [as rocket presets, like this long since deprecated theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webappwriter/not-alphabet-rocket-theme). The install process works perfectly, but it totally works against the personalization/customization process. 

This is because it installs the theme files as finished products. Nope, you want to be adjusting those guys, and you also want to be able know which ones are different from the default rocket files, and how.

So that's why Fins don't go this route.
