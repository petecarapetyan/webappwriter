# I ♥ HTML req || 30

Do these themes come with an _**I Heart HTML/CSS pre-requirement?**_

The answer is "maybe yes, if by _"I ♥ HTML"_ you mean _"this is not the WordPress market"_"

**TL;DR:** Fins-rocket-themes are for coders who want to code something else besides their own sites. These themes are not intended for teams that don't have at least one vaguely-HTML-coder.

**The good news:** You don't have to be a LAMP stack or python or even nodeJS coder. Minor amount of HTML/CSS is enough, and maybe a little javascript and enough patience to put up with a little nunjucks. That's probably most of the active coders on the planet, right now. An occassional visit to [CSS-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com) or [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web), and you're there.

## Conflating themes and a distaste for code

Themes were popularized by WordPress, a tool that is - to some degree - targeted towards people who don't want to code.

By inference then, you could assume this false logic:

- Themes means I don't ever want to code anything.
- I don't know how to do HTML/CSS

## This is not 2003

Take a deep breath, it may be time to untangle some assumptions.

In this context, "themes" is not used in the same sense that it is used in the WordPress marketplace. WordPress was invented in 2003 for a market that was largely incapable of coding - even slightly. At 38m sites by 2021, it worked!

But meanwhile, some of us _**do**_ want the reduced workload of a theme, instead of the responsibilities of coding _**every**_ knit. 

So fins-rocket-themes do not mean zero code, although that is theoretically possible, if not likely.

## Bottom Line?

Fins-rocket-themes are written for _**the millions of us who already write at least a few lines of HTML and/or CSS every year**_ as a part of our regular work in a related area.

We already know how to inspect an element in dev tools, even though we might not make a habit of it.

And we're not afraid of cracking open a file and changing something, because we already use git every day, and know how to commit or not.

We still want to share themes, just maybe not spend a few weeks writing our entire site from scratch.

## Examples of What You Heart to Customize

- You surely want to change the colors of your site in `variables.css`
- You probably want to change how the layout works - at least a little bit - on the home page
- If your theme has secondary menus, you want these to link to specific targets of your choosing.
- You might want to swap out fonts

This is not WordPress - so you're not working through a contrived UI and a SQL database. Just go straight into the files you need to change, and change them. Simple, dumb stuff, hopefully.
