FIXME: everything on this page

need to furnish screen shot here of sample todos
need to distinguish between community and completion
need to distinguish between completion and issues


This is a list of things that is not even on the issues or FIXME list yet.

- naming conventions on the grid areas
- how to launch and compare the grid area blocking views
- side comments about presets and not understanding them
- tabular features checkoff list
- how to deal with the maddening navigation disconnect
- wordpress vs the magical allure of the npm git markdown vscode behavior loop

## github issues

At this time, [github issues for this project](https://github.com/petecarapetyan/fins-rocket-themes/issues) are somewhat course grain in nature. This should evolve to a more realistic fine grain usage.

One of the weird aspects of this project is the back and forth between specific themes and the community. When an issue is raised for a specific theme:

- Should that particular fix be applied to the community of themes?
- Or is it only specific to that one?

This will have to evolve over time

Please feel free to add anything and everything you wish to github issues.
