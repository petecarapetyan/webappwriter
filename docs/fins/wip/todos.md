# Work In Progress >> TODOS || 20

need to furnish screen shot here of sample todos
need to distinguish between community and completion
need to distinguish between completion and issues


This is a list of things that is not even on the WIP list yet.

- naming conventions on the grid areas
- how to launch and compare the grid area blocking views
- side comments about presets and not understanding them
- tabular features checkoff list
- how to deal with the maddening navigation disconnect
- wordpress vs the magical allure of the npm git markdown vscode behavior loop

## Why not use github issues?

instead of this stupid todos page?

Yes, this would be ideal, as soon as the project is formally announced, and more than one person is interested in it's progress.
