# Rocket Themes || 10

_**This page is almost entirely TLDR to explain why I created these rocket themes**_ and what the themes are, and are not, about. [Thumbnails](/rocket-themes/all/thumbnails/) or even [Installation](/rocket-themes/all/installation/) might be more interesting for a first 10 second look.

This page also covers some of the pitfalls.

## Executive Summary

It might be possible that the biggest single factor to Wordpress's success - [currently 38% of the internet](https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/) - is themes? [It's hard to know.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress#History) 

I created [these starter themes](/rocket-themes/all/thumbnails/) as one way to allow Rocket to grow into some of those same markets that would otherwise be unavailable to it.

## Proving out theme-ability

These starter themes give you very modest blocking for theming out your own [rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/) site without getting tangled up in the rocket codebase. Proving out how theming might work is an important step in giving rocket a proper lift-off in the marketplace.

These themes are not currently presented as finished products like Wordpress a theme would, but instead as a head start for devs already planning on creating their own site specific theme from HTML and CSS

Pull requests are accepted, if you wish to improve any of these base themes. Or, publish your own! The whole idea is giving rocket that launch, however acheived.

## Branding and individuality

Humans are crazy about individuality. Everything has to be "my" brand, my personality, nevermind the cost.

Without themes, the rocket market could be temporarily trapped in a Henry-Ford-like _"any color, as long as it is black"_ flavor of marketing hell. That would be unfortunate, because rocket is a great tool.

_**Without themes, rocket can still be individualized.**_ It's just a bit harder, and that little bit can sometimes deter an early adopter. That would be unfortunate.

## Swappable

The biggest challenge with theming any codebase isn't the theme itself, initially. It's making it swappable.

When you write the first implelmentation of anything, especially something as ambitious as [rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/), you have to just blast through the process and get it done. You can't worry about stuff like _"How is the next guy going to customize this header without copypasting the entire `style.css` file into the `_assets` directory?"_. Uh oh.

So it was important for someone to try this first exercise, even if the result itself is not the primary objective.

## Customizeable

Again, contrasting these themes to the mature Wordpress market, each time you "implement" one of these themes, really what you are doing is copypasting in your own one-way fork. That's the bad news.

The good news is that it's very customizeable! And with no additional negative consequences.

## STARTER THEMES ONLY!

These themes are vague beginnings only. Faster to start with something than nothing, you'll still have to do a lot of custom CSS and HTML as you would any good site.

In later years, there will probably be themes that are super-polished, right out of the box. But that is not the intent of these particular themes.

## Dark side, too

Forking off of someone else's fork is always a questionable affair. This is no different. 

What happens when a theme is improved by it's author? Sorry, you already forked. Reconciling that new delta is now a manual affair.
