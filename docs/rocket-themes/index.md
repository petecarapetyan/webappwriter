# Fins || 10

This entire section is months behind the progress of the actual themes.

Everything below was written in January 2021, see the [actual deployed themes linked here](https://github.com/petecarapetyan/fins-rocket-themes#readme) for a more realistic view than what is written below.

Hey! [Thumbnails](/rocket-themes/all/thumbnails/) or even [Installation](/rocket-themes/all/installation/) is where to go if you want the eye-candy or dev view.

## Fins - a collection of Rocket Themes

- [x] Default rocket is simple/dumb/fast to use
- [ ] Default rocket fits my use case

You gotta check _**both**_ boxes. That's a pass fail.

## TLDR, below

Reading below _**may be TLDR**_ unless you need to understand why I created these rocket themes and what the themes are, and are not, about.

This page also covers some of the pitfalls.

## Rocket Themes Use Case

Rocket Themes is my answer to the problem given to me by a former employer, and future customers: _**"We can't use rocket because the site we need doesn't look like that. Sorry."**_ Even if I want to explain that rocket can be customized, the conversation had already ended.

So rocket themes lets me swap look and feel in 30 seconds. 

Now, I've got their attention. Seems silly, but heh, _at least the conversation is still going_. No imagination required - rocket can now be considered for sites that look entirely different.

### But wait! There's more

It also might be possible that the biggest single factor to Wordpress's success - [currently 38% of the internet](https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/) - is themes? [It's hard to know.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress#History) 

I created [these starter themes](/rocket-themes/all/thumbnails/) as one way to allow rocket to eventually grow into some of those same markets that would otherwise be unavailable to it.

## Proving out theme-ability

These starter themes give you very modest blocking for theming out your own [rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/) site without getting tangled up in the rocket codebase. Proving out how theming might work is an important step in giving rocket a proper lift-off in the marketplace.

These themes are not _**currently**_ presented as finished products like Wordpress a theme would, but instead as a head start for devs already planning on creating their own site specific theme from HTML and CSS

Pull requests are accepted, if you wish to improve any of these base themes. Or, publish your own! The whole idea is giving rocket that launch, however acheived.

## Branding and individuality

Humans are crazy about individuality. Everything has to be "my" brand, my personality, nevermind other issues.

Without themes, the rocket market could be temporarily trapped in a Henry-Ford-like _"any color, as long as it is black"_ flavor of marketing hell. That would be unfortunate, because rocket is a great tool.

_**Without themes, rocket can still be individualized.**_ It's just a bit less obvious, and that little bit can sometimes deter an early adopter. Early adopters are our best friends :)

## Swappable

The biggest challenge with theming any codebase isn't the theme itself, initially. It's making it swappable.

When you write the first implelmentation of anything, especially something as ambitious as [rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/), you have to just blast through the process and get it done. You can't worry about stuff like _"How is the next guy going to customize this header without copypasting the entire `style.css` file into the `_assets` directory?"_. Uh oh.

So it was important for someone to try this first exercise, even if the result itself is not the primary objective.

## Customizeable

Again, contrasting these themes to the mature Wordpress market, each time you "implement" one of these themes, really what you are doing is copypasting in your own one-way fork. That's the bad news.

The good news is that, now you've kicked off the customization process on steroids and made it super obvious. That can be helpful.

## Dark side, too

Forking off of someone else's fork is always a questionable affair. Themes are no different, in that respect.

What happens when a theme is improved by it's author? Sorry, you already forked. Reconciling that new delta is now a manual affair.
