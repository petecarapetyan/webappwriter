# Incomplete themes || 90

_All 18 themes are currently incomplete. This page only makes more nonsense out of that condition._

<hr>

"Incomplete" is used in these docs in two very differents senses of the word:

- Incomplete as in _"Not yet finished, you will need to provide some HTML/CSS etc"_
- Incomplete as in _"Final customization by the consumer of this theme is expected, even after the theme is declared finished."_

## Defining a complete theme

The benchmark for great themes is projects such as Wordpress, where one can install a theme, use the defaults, and come up with an absolutely beautiful and functional result.

Default rocket also defines such a standard. If you use rocket out of the box without one of these themes, you're going to have great results.

## Different ideas about use cases

The line gets fuzzy around incomplete when you think about specific use cases. 

A perfectly complete theme, for example, might not serve a specific use case. _"We're trying to keep it ultra-simple so we don't have a search button"_. So one man's complete theme might be incomplete, in another perspective.

## How should I expect to finish an incomplete theme?

In all themes provided here at present, _**you will need to do extensive work, just to use the theme on your site.**_ 

Hence the Proof of Concept status label.

1. You will need to make basic HTML/CSS work, even on what is already here.
1. You will need to provide additional content/HTML/CSS to make the theme usable.
