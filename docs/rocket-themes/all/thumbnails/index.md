## Internal pages

Any theme would naturally have both of these layouts:

- a home page (such as all above home pages starting with prefix "not-")
- internal pages, displayed with the `with-sidebar` layout in the rocket codebase

When you select one of the `not-` prefixed themes above, each comes with the following `any-with-sidebar` theme for internal pages. 

It is expected that you might wish to modify this theme later to suit your needs. It would look like this, out of the box:
